I made this model of a woman who is suffering from ALS disease, her mobility has been damaged as her fine finger movement is gone.
She loves reading books but she can't turn the pages herself. 
I print this model for her, the model is put on the wrist, and with the thinness and the flexibility of the model, the page can be flipped

 The main body is made of PLA and print time is about 9 hours.
